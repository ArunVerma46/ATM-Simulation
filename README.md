# ATM-Simulation
 This Python program simulates an ATM system using a command-line interface. Users can log in with a PIN, check balance, deposit, withdraw (with a \$500 daily limit), transfer money, and log out. It uses object-oriented programming with `Account` and `ATM` classes, making it great for beginners learning OOP concepts.
